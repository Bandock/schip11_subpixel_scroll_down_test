# SuperCHIP V1.1 Subpixel Scroll Down Test
This SuperCHIP V1.1 related test is designed to see if the implementing interpreter properly supports subpixel scrolling in low resolution.

It will show a `thumbs up` if it is supported or `thumbs down` if it is not.  If your interpreter displays a `thumbs up`, it supports it.
